As a web developer, the biggest challenge is integration, i.e., the website should synchronize with the apps. A web developer is also responsible for building a user friendly and a responsive website. The website should load faster and pave way for a convenient use. There are other challenges like security, wherein the website must be prevented from getting hacked or subjected to any kind of attacks. So a front-end web developer is responsible for building a web app which should adapt to the device on which it is used.
