Transferable skills or portable skills include all skills and abilities that can be transferable depending on where they are being transferred to and from. As a web developer, it is important to use your current skills as a raw clue and try finding solutions for existing problems and challenges. Talents and abilities you can take from job to job, or use in multiple careers, are called transferable skills. 
  As a web developer, being stuck somewhere in the mid, you can use your transferable skills and problem solving skills. Your communication skills (like having given your academic project presentation with a team of 4, a technical seminar) would be of a great use so that you can consult and communicate with peers and try getting a solution. As you have some planning skills like prioritizing tasks and time management, these may help you out in solving problems as what to do next. Coming to the basic skills, you might try to communicate in writing, receive feedback and try getting a solution to your problem.
